## Who Am I
I'm Eren, a second-year Computer Science student at **Bilkent University**. These days I'm educating myself on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Vision**. I'm also interested in backend development and DevOps.

I'm relatively skilled in C++ and Java. I also have used Python and Rust in some of my personal projects. In projects, I pay great attention to completeness and security.

I want to do research about **Theory of Computation** and **Bioinformatics** in the future.

If you're interested in working with me, here's my resume [in English]({{ site.url }}/assets/Sukru-Eren-Gokirmak-CV-English.pdf) and [in Turkish]({{ site.url }}/assets/Sukru-Eren-Gokirmak-CV-Turkce.pdf).
